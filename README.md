### `Splyt React Code Challenge`

The task was to create a single page Javascript application using React. The page features a map. The map should show markers illustrating the up-to-date locations of on-demand taxis in the area. The page has a UI-Slider from Material UI's API, it is ranged between 1 to 50 and you can slide it across to change the amount of drivers shown in the area. 

For this project, I used 2 third party API (not including Splyt's Get Request endpoint)
1) Google Maps API
2) Material UI's Slider API
